//! Native Linux helper for the embedded blockwork-gd mod running under Proton.
//!
//! `WH_KEYBOARD_LL`/`WH_MOUSE_LL` don't see real host input under Wine, and
//! `SendInput`-based emission is unreliable there too (both confirmed
//! empirically against a real Proton/GD session). This process is launched
//! by `blockwork-ffi` (see its Wine-detection code) and bridges real input
//! across a shared-memory region at the path given as `argv[1]`:
//!
//! - capture: reads `/dev/input/event*` directly (non-exclusive — see the
//!   module-level reasoning in the project plan for why this never grabs
//!   devices) and pushes `wire::WireCapture` messages into the capture ring.
//! - control/run: pops `wire::WireControlCommand`s off the control ring.
//!   `RunMacro(id)` loads that macro straight from the OS-default config
//!   dir (the same real directory the Windows side's `macros-dir` override
//!   setting reaches via its `Z:` mapping) and runs it natively, right
//!   here. This is the whole reason this process exists rather than the
//!   Windows side just running the macro itself and shipping individual
//!   input events across: `raise_current_thread_priority()`'s `#[cfg(unix)]`
//!   branch gets real `SCHED_FIFO` here, whereas the same call inside the
//!   Wine-hosted mod process only gets Wine's much weaker emulation of
//!   `SetThreadPriority`.
//!
//!   Emission uses `EvdevBackend` (`uinput`) - the same one the native
//!   Linux desktop app uses. An `XTestBackend` (X Test extension) briefly
//!   replaced it, on the theory that talking to the X server directly
//!   would skip hops `uinput` takes through the kernel/libinput/compositor
//!   before reaching an XWayland client. That's wrong for a Wine install
//!   using `winewayland.drv` (Wine's native Wayland driver, not XWayland) -
//!   there GD is a native Wayland client with no X11 involvement at all,
//!   so `uinput`'s path (kernel evdev -> libinput -> compositor -> Wayland
//!   client) is identical for real hardware and synthetic input alike, and
//!   XTest events went to the system's Xwayland instance instead, which
//!   this GD install was never a client of - they just went nowhere.
//!
//! Exits if the Windows side's heartbeat goes stale (GD closed/crashed),
//! so this never orphans itself.
