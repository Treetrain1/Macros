# Builds dist/Blockwork.app: a proper macOS app bundle with the CEF framework
# and helper processes alongside the main binary.
#
# cef-dll-sys deliberately doesn't place CEF's runtime files for you on macOS
# (unlike Linux/Windows, where it copies them next to target/<triple>/release/) --
# see the "leave it to tools like tauri-cli for now" comment in its build.rs.
# This script is that missing packaging step: it assembles the standard
# CEF/Chromium bundle layout (Contents/Frameworks/Chromium Embedded
# Framework.framework + a Helper.app per CEF subprocess type) and ad-hoc
# code-signs the result, since Apple Silicon refuses to run unsigned
# executables at all (not just a Gatekeeper warning -- see the note below).
#
# Usage: scripts/build-macos-bundle.sh [target-triple]
# Defaults to the host's native target triple.
